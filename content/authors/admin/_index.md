Kara Fulton is a neuroscientist and postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck-affiliated Research Center [caesar](caesar.de) in Bonn, Germany. She holds a Ph.D. in neuroscience from Brown University and a bachelors degree in mathematics from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Her research interests include sensory neuroscience, correlative microscopy, and mathematical modeling of neural circuit computations.

As a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of [Dr. Kevin Briggman](https://www.caesar.de/en/research/groups/computational-neuroethology/research-focus.html), she investigates the functional and structural wiring specificity of interneurons in the mouse olfactory bulb. During her graduate studies, Dr. Fulton generated the first dense reconstruction of a mammalian olfactory circuit using correlative light and electron microscopy. She aims to combine cellular-resolution protein expression of neuronal cell types with synaptic connectivity and physiology in order to generate network-level computational models of brain circuits.

She is devoted to mentorship and is committed to training students from under-represented backgrounds in STEM. She is active with Skype a Scientist and serves as an advisor to undergraduates and high school students interested in a career in Neuroscience through the Simply Neuroscience Advising Program. 

Dr. Fulton is an incoming postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of [Dr. Bob Datta](datta.hms.harvard.edu) at Harvard Medical School in 2021.
